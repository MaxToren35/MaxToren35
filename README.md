Hi my name is Max Toren. I coded all of my middle school and most of elementray school. I am taking this class because I want to advance my coding, but this course also looks really good in your collage resumae. I love playing both soccer and basketball, as they let me have fun with my friends and keep me entertained. Some goals that I have for this class is creating a game like project by the end of the year.
